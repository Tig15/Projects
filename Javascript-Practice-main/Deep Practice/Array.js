// An Array is an Object that can store the multiple values at once. There are two ways to create an array, 1) Using an array literal and 2) Using the new Keyword.

const flower = ["Lily", "Lavender", "Tulip", "Orchids"] // Array Literal

const sky = new Array("Blue","Orange", "Dark","Yellow","Purple") // New keyword

const voids = [] // Empty Array

console.log(flower[2])
console.log(sky[2])
console.log(voids)

// Here, the four values are added into flower. Because it would be lengthy to create a single variable for one flower. So, that's why, we use an Array. To reduce the code and write down many values in single variable inside []. Then we target each values by their index number.

// What is Index in Array? A location of value inside the []. Which starts with 0 numbering.
